Small unil which uses Freebsd cpuctl interface to read aperf/mperf msr and calculate
-actual core clock rate
-how much it is throttled

Not terrebly accurate since cpuctl do not allow to read APERF/MPERF back to back with disabled irqs/preemtion, but can give a general idea is core throttled or not.
